# Base13

Base13 is a color theme management system based on a 13-color palette.

Like [Base16][], Base13 is based on a 16-color palette and provides consistent colors across applications. It differs by being simpler and more hackable. With Base13, you can easily:

- Switch color themes in all apps at once.
- Customize the color values in a scheme.
- Set app-independent syntax highlighting rules.
